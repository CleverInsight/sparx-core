## Background
Work on sparx started at CleverInsight Labs in 2018 and has been under active development since then.


## Discussion and Development
Most development discussion is taking place on github in this repo. Further, the sparx-core mailing list can also be used for specialized discussions or design issues, and a Gitter channel is available for quick development related questions.

## Contributing to Sparx-Core
All contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements and ideas are welcome.

A detailed overview on how to contribute can be found in the contributing guide. There is also an overview on GitHub.

If you are simply looking to start working with the sparx codebase, navigate to the GitHub "issues" tab and start looking through interesting issues. There are a number of issues listed under Docs and good first issue where you could start out.

You can also triage issues which may include reproducing bug reports, or asking for vital information such as version numbers or reproduction instructions. If you would like to start triaging issues, one easy way to get started is to subscribe to sparx.

Or maybe through using sparx you have an idea of your own or are looking for something in the documentation and thinking ‘this can be improved’...you can do something about it!

Feel free to ask questions on the mailing list or on Gitter.
